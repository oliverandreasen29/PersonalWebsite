            <p class = "AboutText">From the early age of 11, I developed a deep passion for coding and computers. 
                What started as curiosity quickly developed into a huge interest leading me to experiment with various
                microcomputers such as the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Microbit. I spent hours learning how to write code
                and understand the intricate workings of both hardware and software inside computers.<br><br>
                Now, at the age of 15, I am a dedicated GCSE student with a strong focus on mathematics, physics, and
                computer science. My passion for coding has only grown over the years along with my ambition to pursue
                a career as either a software engineer or a car tuner. I find satisfaction in problem-solving and pushing
                the boundaries of what I can achieve.<br><br>
                Beyond my academic and technology intrests I also prioritise maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Twice a week, I 
                go climbing locally which challenges both my physical and mental endurance. Additionally, since the age
                of 10 I have attended weekly personal training sessions helping me stay fit, disciplined, and focused.<br><br>
                Balancing my love for technology with an active lifestyle has made me always eager to learn, improve, and take
                on new challenges which come with life. I am always looking for ways to push my limits and grow overall.<br><br>In May 2025, I completed a one-week mechanical work experience placement at JM Imports,
                a supercar garage specializing in tuning, servicing, performance parts, and import car sales. During this time, I was involved in gearbox builds, fabrication, engineering, dyno rolling road testing
                and general garage tasks. Following this placement, I was offered a Saturday job assisting the mechanics, tidying the workshop, and continuing to learn more about high-performance and imported cars.</p>

                        as his climbing instructor, for several years and have seen a strong progression within his abilities
                        and his confidence. When I first started coaching him, he was quite shy, but as time went on he has
                        opened up and his confidence has grown. He is always very polite, and consistently punctual to sessions
                        with a strong desire to improve upon his physical abilities and techniques.<br><br>Due to his eagerness
                        to improve, he pays close attention to instructions and implements them well. In climbing, trying a
                        multitude of different solutions is very important and helps to refine problem solving. Oliver is very
                        open to trying different approaches when faced with challenges and doesn’t limit himself to one
                        potential solution. He is aware of the potential hazards that come with a sport such as climbing
                        and has a strong sense of safety awareness and prevention of situations that could cause hazards.
                        <br><br>In recent months, as per my recommendation he has also started climbing in our coaching academy,
                        which is by invite only for only our most talented climbers. It is my belief that with his decision
                        -making abilities, willingness to embrace and implement instructions and his commitment to progression,
                        Oliver will have a bright future in not just climbing but other future endeavours.”<br><br>
