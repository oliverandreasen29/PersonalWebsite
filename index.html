                Alongside my education, I love doing physical activity and coding both<br>front and backend software for
                applications or websites. Currently I live<br>in England but love to explore the world on holidays

            <p class = "AboutText">From the early age of 11, I developed a deep passion for coding and computers. 
                What started as curiosity quickly developed into a huge interest leading me to experimentwith various
                microcomputers such as the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Microbit. I spent hours learning how to write code
                and understand the intricate workings of both hardware and software inside computers.<br><br>
                Now, at the age of 15, I am a dedicated GCSE student with a strong focus on mathematics, physics, and
                computer science. My passion for coding has only grown over the years along with my ambition to pursue
                a career as either a software engineer or a car tuner. I find satisfaction in problem-solving and pushing
                the boundaries of what I can achieve.<br><br>
                Beyond my academic and technology intrests I also prioritize maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Twice a week
                , I go climbing locally which challenges both my physical and mental endurance. Additionally, since the age
                of 10 I have attended weekly personal training sessions helping me stay fit, disciplined, and focused.<br><br>
                Balancing my love for technology with an active lifestyle has made me always eager to learn, improve, and take
                on new challenges which come with life. I am always looking for ways to push my limits and grow overall.</p>

                        half terms as a maternity cover. During our weekly one-hour session I always found him to be a delight
                        to work with. He is a well-mannered and receptive student with a genuine interest in the subject. He
                        picks up new ideas quickly and enjoys spending time on consolidation work to master these skills. Topics
                        covered included higher level indices, algebraic standard form, trigonometry in 3 dimensions, circle
                        theorems, and extended proportionality equation questions. All were completely mastered with end of
                        term exam scores of 93% in December and 85% in February. I have no hesitation in saying Oliver is well
                        suited to A Level maths and would love to have him in my class.”<br><br>Andrew Snedden, Former Teacher

                        always engaging in lessons and demonstrating his excellent subject knowledge during class discussion.
                        Oliver is developing his coding skills both in and out of the classroom and confidently applies the
                        Python coding skills learnt so far when solving a wide range of programming challenges. He always
                        embraces challenges and is not afraid to test out different techniques when developing a coded solution
                        and always persevering. Oliver is highly suited to studying A Level Computer Science. He has a strong
                        passion for the subject and is already demonstrating excellence in advanced GCSE coding techniques.
                        He also has a keen interest in learning about object-oriented programming, showing enthusiasm for
                        developing his skills further.”

                        as his climbing instructor, for several years and have seen a strong progression within his abilities
                        and his confidence. When I first started coaching him, he was quite shy, but as time went on he has
                        opened up and his confidence has grown. He is always very polite, and consistently punctual to sessions
                        with a strong desire to improve upon his physical abilities and techniques.<br><br>Due to his eagerness
                        to improve, he pays close attention to instructions and implements them well. In climbing, trying a
                        multitude of different solutions is very important and helps to refine problem solving. Oliver is very
                        open to trying different approaches when faced with challenges and doesn’t limit himself to one
                        potential solution. He is aware of the potential hazards that come with a sport such as climbing
                        and has a strong sense of safety awareness and prevention of situations that could cause hazards.
                        <br><br>In recent months, as per my recommendation he has also started climbing in our coaching academy,
                        which is by invite only for only our most talented climbers. It is my belief that with his decision
                        -making abilities, willingness to embrace and implement instructions and his commitment to progression,
                        Oliver will have a bright future in not just climbing but other future endeavours.”<br><br>

                        on time for his session, is extremely polite with impeccable manners and always neatly turned out. He
                        has helped me by volunteering with other classes over this period. He listens well to instructions but
                        can also work on his own initiative and take action independently which is great when you have a busy
                        class with many disabilities within. He is liked by everyone and a great role model to my younger and
